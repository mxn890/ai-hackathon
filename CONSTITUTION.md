# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - Constitution

## Project Mission
Create a comprehensive, educational textbook that teaches Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics to university-level students. The textbook must bridge theoretical AI knowledge with practical robotic applications in simulated and real-world environments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Educational Excellence
- Content must be clear, accurate, and accessible to students with basic programming knowledge
- Each concept builds progressively on previous knowledge
- Real-world examples and applications included throughout
- Code examples are functional, well-commented, and educational

### 2. Technical Accuracy
- All technical information must be current and accurate
- Code examples must follow best practices
- Hardware specifications must be realistic and achievable
- Software versions and dependencies clearly documented

### 3. Practical Focus
- Theory is always connected to practical implementation
- Each module includes hands-on examples
- Simulation-first approach (accessible to all students)
- Clear path from simulation to real hardware

### 4. Structured Learning
- Clear learning objectives for each chapter
- Progressive difficulty (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- Assessments and exercises at key points
- Capstone project integrates all concepts

## Content Standards

### Writing Style
- Professional but approachable tone
- Technical terms defined on first use
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Active voice preferred
- International English (accessible globally)

### Code Standards
- Python 3.10+ for all examples
- PEP 8 style guidelines
- Detailed comments explaining logic
- Error handling included
- Dependencies clearly listed

### Visual Standards
- Diagrams for complex concepts
- Screenshots of key interfaces
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Consistent formatting throughout

## Module Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Focus**: Foundation - Understanding robot communication and control
**Weeks**: 3-5
**Outcome**: Students can create basic ROS 2 nodes and understand robot architecture

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Focus**: Simulation - Creating virtual environments for testing
**Weeks**: 6-7
**Outcome**: Students can simulate robots in realistic physics environments

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
**Focus**: Perception - Teaching robots to see and understand
**Weeks**: 8-10
**Outcome**: Students implement vision systems and navigation

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Focus**: Intelligence - Combining AI with physical action
**Weeks**: 11-13
**Outcome**: Students build robots that understand voice commands and plan actions

## Quality Requirements

### Content Quality
- No plagiarism - all content original or properly cited
- Technical accuracy verified
- Code tested and functional
- Grammar and spelling checked

### User Experience
- Fast page load times
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear navigation structure
- Search functionality
- Accessible to users with disabilities

### Deployment
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
- Version controlled with Git
- Professional documentation

## Success Criteria

A successful textbook will:
1. Cover all four modules comprehensively
2. Include working code examples throughout
3. Provide clear learning path from basics to capstone
4. Be deployable and accessible online
5. Include integrated RAG chatbot for student questions
6. Meet all hackathon technical requirements

## Constraints

### Time
- Delivery deadline: Sunday 11:59 PM
- Focus on core requirements first
- Bonus features only after base is complete

### Technical
- Must work with Docusaurus
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design required
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Scope
- Focus on simulation (hardware optional)
- Assume students have basic Python knowledge
- Prioritize clarity over exhaustive detail
- Balance breadth and depth appropriately
